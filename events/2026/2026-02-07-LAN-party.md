The servers have awoken. The LAN calls for bodies.

**Bring with you:**
- Your rig (blessed be thy GPU)
- Your peripherals (may thy switches be loud)
- Your power cables (for the love of god don't forget them)
- Your LAN cable (WiFi is heresy)

**What to expect:**
- Competitive chaos
- Unholy teammate decisions
- Pizza-based survival mechanics
- War cries, excuses, and "HOW WAS THAT A HEADSHOT?!"
- Energy drinks of questionable origin

**Rules of the realm:**
- No lag
- No mercy
- No excuses
- Only GGs (and emotional damage)

Load your games. Update your drivers. Sharpen your insults.

GG or uninstall.
